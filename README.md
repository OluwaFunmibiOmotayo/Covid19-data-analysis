# Covid19-data-analysis

## Overview

This project is based on data from The New York Times, which has aggregated reported COVID-19 data from state and local governments and health departments since 2020. The data includes county-level reports of cumulative cases and deaths, which are analyzed over the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. Additionally, county-level population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau are used to calculate statistics per 100,000 people.

The goal of this project is to:

Analyze the daily cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths at the county level.

Visualize the spread and impact of COVID-19 across counties in the U.S. using geographic mapping techniques.
